# Offensive Python Arsenal

---

Welcome to the **Offensive Python Arsenal**! This repository is your go-to spot for a collection of powerful Python scripts and utilities crafted for offensive security operations. Whether you're sharpening your penetration testing skills, diving deep into security research, or just curious about how Python can be wielded in the red team world, you'll find practical, hands-on tools here.

From crafting custom network clients to dissecting packets and automating web attacks, these tools are built to help you understand and interact with systems from an offensive perspective.

**Heads up**: These tools are strictly for **ethical hacking, security research, and educational purposes**. Using them against any system or network without explicit, written permission is illegal and irresponsible. The author takes no responsibility for any misuse. Please hack responsibly!

## What's Inside? A Peek at the Tools

Here's a breakdown of the capabilities you'll find, organized by their primary focus:

## Getting Started

To dive in, you'll need **Python 3.x** installed. Most tools will have their dependencies listed within their respective directories, typically installable via `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # Check each tool's directory for its specific requirements.txt
